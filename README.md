# dungeons
This is my map viewer for dungeoneering for Windows, written in C#, with the following features
* Automatic calibration and re-calibration
* 100% accurate room counter (non-guide mode)
* Gridlines
* Path lines
* Critical room bookkeeping (access this feature by right-clicking any room on the map)
* Room annotations (useful for keeping track of key doors)
* Save the map to an image with one click (TODO: save location is currently hardcoded, lol)
